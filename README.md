# Machine-Learning(Heart Disease)
Created ML Models to train the label dataset.

I have extracted features of heart disease patients and normal person then Iâ€™m create 
an ML model on the label dataset to classify the person has high risk or low risk. To complete this ML project we are using 
the supervised machine learning algorithm. My model gives the accuracy rate of 86.3%.
